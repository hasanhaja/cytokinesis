# Cytokinesis

> Cytokinesis is the final process in eukaryotic cell division... [which] typically occurs at the end of mitosis ([source](https://biologydictionary.net/cytokinesis/))

This project was inspired by what [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) enables for component library development and the power of [Mitosis](https://github.com/builderIO/mitosis). The purpose of this project is to start piecing together the developer experience of Mitosis with Astro to replicate the developer experience of building things with Storybook.
